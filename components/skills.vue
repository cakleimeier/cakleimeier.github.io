						I’ve built, maintained, updated, and upgraded custom websites using Content Management Systems (CMS). Whenever needed, I’ve written custom functionality to integrate with those CMSs.

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Craft CMS</li>
						<li>Yii</li>
						<li>Laravel</li>
						<li>PHP</li>

						<strong>Documentation</strong>: I write clear, <em>useful</em> documentation for clients and developers. I’m skilled in researching, synthesizing, and communicating complex concepts in simple and practical language.
						<br />
						<strong>Communication</strong>: I communicate with clients to clarify and manage expectations, gather information, and maintain relationships. I act as a liaison between clients and the team. I handle difficult situations with compassion, tact, and <em>patience</em>. I can read a room and fit into the culture. I conduct myself with professionalism and friendliness in calls and meetings, both in person and remotely.
						<br />
						<strong>Problem Solving</strong>: I ask good, insightful questions. I research, strategize, hypothesize, and test to find the best possible solution.
						<br />
						<strong>Teamwork</strong>: With the right team, I thrive. I lighten the load for others when I can, I know when and how to ask for help, and I try to keep the atmosphere light. I communicate frequently and clearly, I work to get and keep everyone on the same page, and I <em>lead</em> when called.
